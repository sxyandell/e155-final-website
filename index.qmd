## Abstract
The goal of this project was to design an analog style synthesizer with an instrument that makes sound when
 you spin it, press keys or turn a potentiometer. The project would generate real time audio controlled by a digital 
 gyroscope, keypad, and a potentiometer. The system would produce two independent audio outputs, each corresponding to a 
 distinct sound source. The gyroscope, mounted on a rotating device, determines a baseline sound output to one speaker based on its rotational 
frequency, while the keypad and potentiometer control the note and pitch of a second, independent sound output to a different 
speaker.

Our project ended up being a functional prototype of the spinning synth. The 8-key keypad plays a C-major 
scale directly from the MCU to a speaker, the A3G4250DTR gyroscope 
is read over SPI, and the MCU uses its ADC to read the 10k Ohm potentiometer.
