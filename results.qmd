## Key Results

- Audio outputs: Two independent channels produced in real time
- Frequency mapping: Gyro-derived baseline and keypad-derived note frequencies
- Filtering: FPGA-based LPF/HPF/BPF applied successfully to waveforms

## Measurements

- Sampling rates and effective audio bandwidths
- End-to-end latency (input to analog output)
- Signal-to-noise ratio (post-filter)
- Frequency accuracy (tuning errors vs. target)
- Resource utilization (FPGA LUTs/BRAM/DSPs; MCU CPU/memory)

## Discussion
